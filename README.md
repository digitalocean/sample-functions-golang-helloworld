# Sample Function: Go "Hello World"

## Introduction

This repository contains a sample "Hello World" function written in Go. You can deploy it on DigitalOcean's App Platform as a Serverless Function component. Documentation is available at https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/functions.

### Requirements

* To deploy from the command line, you will need the [DigitalOcean `doctl` CLI](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl/releases).

## Deploying the Function

```bash
# clone this repo
git clone git@github.com:digitalocean/sample-functions-golang-helloworld.git
